        Property management:</h2>
    <strong>
            Property management involves overseeing and taking care of real estate, like houses or apartments, on behalf of owners.
            Property managers handle tasks such as finding tenants, collecting rent, and ensuring the property is well-maintained.
            They act as a bridge between landlords and tenants, addressing issues and making sure everything runs smoothly.
            Their responsibilities also include handling repairs, handling leases, and ensuring legal compliance.
            Essentially, property management aims to make owning and renting property hassle-free for owners while providing a 
            comfortable and secure living environment for tenants.
